- 👋 Hi, I’m @edwardvish
- 👀 I’m interested in Quality Assurance, automated testing frameworks, and the integration of continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines to enhance software quality and efficiency. My passion lies in crafting robust, scalable test automation solutions using Python and Selenium.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced concepts in Selenium for more efficient web automation, exploring AI-based testing tools for enhanced test accuracy, and diving deeper into performance and security testing to broaden my QA expertise.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects focused on testing tools and frameworks, especially those that aim to simplify and improve automated testing processes. I'm also interested in contributing to projects that leverage Python for test automation and Selenium for browser automation.
